## Motivation:
A lot of new graduated developers just emailed me and asked about where to start learning React-Redux. They mentioned the difficulty to search a tutorial with simple demo code and explanation, while most of the existing tutorials are focusing on the concepts of Redux, which are very hard to understand as a beginner.

## Purpose:
That’s the motivation of this article, to give you an complete structure of React-Redux project with just simple components within it. Easy to understand, expand friendly.

## Content:
With this tutorial, I’m going to show what React-Redux developers care about and demonstrate how to scaffold a react-redux based project from facebook official create-react-app, as well as how to expand it into an React-Redux front-end application.
You will be afterwards very easy to integrate the front-end app with any type of REST backends(such as express in JS or Pyramid in Python, see more details from the tutorial, Create RESTful backend with ExpressJS(Nodejs) in 5 mins)
